spin wheel(wheel_list):
	choose random entry from wheel list
	return the value of the entry

establish 3 players (ask for names?)
- store in two dictionaries: {name : round score} and {name : bank}

#round 1
introduce first puzzle

currentplayer = 1
while puzzle not solved:
	display puzzle and available letters
	prompt player to spin wheel
	if not bankrupt or lose turn:
		guess a letter
		remove letter from available letters
		if letter in puzzle_string:
			reveal letters in puzzle
			add (spin result * number of revealed letters) to current player's score
			while not spinning again:
				ask to spin, buy vowel (if score > 250), or solve
				if buy vowel:
					subtract 250 from current player's score
					remove letter from available letters
					if letter in puzzle_string:
						reveal letters in puzzle
					else:
						go to next player
				elif solve:
					player types in puzzle answer
					if correct:
						reveal all letters
						bank current player's score
						go to next round
					else:
						go to next player
				elif spin:
					repeat from "prompt player to spin wheel"
				else:
					bad input, try again
		else:
			tell player that letter wasn't in the puzzle
			move on to next player
	elif bankrupt:
		current player's score = 0
		move on to next player
	else:
		move on to next player
	currentplayer += 1
	if currentplayer > 3:
		currentplayer -= 3
